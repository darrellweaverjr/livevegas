                <h2>This Privacy Policy applies to the sites and apps where it appears.</h2>

                <p>Our goal is to make your purchasing experience easy, efficient and equitable, so we can get you on your way to live events as quickly as possible. The following is designed to ensure your satisfaction and understanding of the purchase process on the Ticketmaster sites and applications where this appears, including sites and applications where we facilitate ticket resale transactions such as Fan-to-Fan (collectively, the "Site"). If you have any questions, please <a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/How-do-I-contact-Customer-Service?language=en_US" rel="noopener">contact us</a>. Your purchases on our Site are subject to these terms. Please also review our <a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/Terms-of-Use?language=en_US" rel="noopener">Terms of Use</a> which govern your use of our Site.</p>

                <h2>Currency</h2>

                <p>All ticket prices for events that occur in the United States are stated in U.S. Dollars. All ticket prices for events that occur in Canada are stated in Canadian Dollars.</p>

                <h2>Payment Methods</h2>

                <p>We accept several methods of payment to accommodate your needs. If the event for which you are buying tickets is located in the United States, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ticketmaster.com" rel="noopener">Ticketmaster.com</a> accepts, among other forms of payment, American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Diner's Club, and Ticketmaster gift cards for qualifying events. If the event for which you are buying tickets is located in Canada, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ticketmaster.ca" rel="noopener">Ticketmaster.ca</a> accepts, among other forms of payment, American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Sears MasterCard Canada and Ticketmaster gift cards for qualifying events.</p>

                <h2>Who You Are Buying From</h2>

                <p>Ticketmaster acts as the agent to those who provide events, such as venues, teams, artist representatives and fan clubs, promoters and leagues ("Event Providers"). We generally sell tickets on behalf of our clients including artists, teams, venues, and promoters, though in some rare instances we may own a small number of tickets as part of our services contract with the individual client. When you purchase a ticket for an event that is located in the United States, then Ticketmaster LLC will be handling the transaction and collecting payment for the Event Provider. When you purchase a ticket for an event that is located in Canada, then Ticketmaster Canada Ltd. will be handling the transaction and collecting payment for the Event Provider.</p>

                <p>If you purchase a resale ticket through Fan-to-Fan, you will be purchasing that ticket from either (a) a reseller who is not an Event Provider, such as other fans or season ticket holders, or (b) in limited circumstances, the Event Provider. Your Fan-to-Fan listing will also appear on our resale partner sites. If for any reason Fan-to-Fan becomes unavailable for your event, your listing will be removed from our site only.</p>

                <p>Tickets obtained from unauthorized sources may be lost, stolen or counterfeit, and if so are void.</p>

                <h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>

                <p>We sell tickets on behalf of Event Providers, which means we do not set the ticket prices or determine seating locations. Our clients typically set the face price of their tickets. Tickets are generally sold through several distribution points, including websites, apps and box offices. Most distribution points generally access the same ticketing system and inventory; therefore, tickets for popular events may sell out quickly. Occasionally, additional tickets may be available prior to the event. However, we do not control this inventory or its availability. Check out our FAQs section for more information on ticket availability. Similarly, we facilitate 3rd party ticket resale transactions through Fan-to-Fan, but do not set the ticket prices or determine seating locations of those resale tickets. Please be aware that resale tickets are often posted for sale via Fan-to-Fan at prices that are higher than their original prices. Ticketmaster may charge fulfillment, shipping, service or other fees for using our services. <u>Ticketmaster may change such fees at any time, including after you post your tickets.</u></p>

                <h2>Order Confirmation</h2>

                <p>If you do not receive a confirmation number (in the form of a confirmation page or email) after submitting payment information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility to confirm via your Ticketmaster account or Ticketmaster Fan Support whether or not your order has been placed. Only you may be aware of any problems that may occur during the purchase process. We will not be responsible for losses (monetary or otherwise) if you assume that an order was not placed because you failed to receive confirmation.</p>

                <h2>Service Fees and Order Processing Fees</h2>

                <p>Tickets purchased on our Site are typically subject to a per ticket service fee and a per order processing fee. In many cases, delivery fees will also be owed. You may be able, in some instances, to purchase tickets directly from the venue box office without paying our service fee. For resale tickets, the buyer will pay fees that may be reflected during the purchase process or that may be included and deducted from the amount displayed as the resale price of the ticket.</p>

                <h2>Number of Tickets or "Ticket Limits"</h2>

                <p>When purchasing tickets on our Site, you are limited to a specified number of tickets for each event (also known as a "ticket limit"). This ticket limit is posted during the purchase process and is verified with every transaction. This policy is in effect to discourage unfair ticket buying practices. Each Ticketmaster account must be linked to a unique individual and contain valid, and verifiable, information. Multiple accounts may not be used to circumvent or exceed published ticket limits. We reserve the right to cancel any or all orders and tickets, in addition to prohibiting your ticket purchase abilities, without notice to you, if you exceed or attempt to exceed, the posted ticket limits. Any tickets, cancelled due to violating the posted ticket limit, will be refunded at face value (excluding fees). This includes orders associated with the same name, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number or other information.</p>

                <h2>Ticket Transfer</h2>

                <p>Once a recipient accepts a ticket transfer, a new barcode is issued and the sender's tickets are invalid. If a ticket has been transferred multiple times, only the ticket from the last transfer will be valid for event entry – all previous ticket barcodes will be invalidated.</p>

                <p>The sender can modify or cancel a ticket transfer <i>before</i> the recipient accepts the transfer – not after. Note: We may cancel transferred tickets, at any time, if we determine that they were obtained fraudulently or otherwise in violation of our policies; therefore, it is important that you know and trust the individual transferring tickets to you before accepting them. If an event is canceled or rescheduled, only the original purchaser will be eligible for a refund.</p>

                <p>Recipients can choose only Mobile or Print-at-Home delivery (if the event offers it). All merchandise, VIP package elements, fan club memberships, and ticket insurance originally purchased or included with the ticket are not transferable. Ticket insurance will not apply to transferred tickets.</p>

                <h2>Opening Acts / Festival Acts</h2>

                <p>Opening acts or guests may sometimes tour with headlining performers. We are not always made aware of opening acts or the length of their performances. Opening acts, as well as festival performers, are subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice. No refund will be owed if an opening act or festival performer is changed or canceled.</p>

                <h2>Canceled and Rescheduled Events</h2>

                <p>Occasionally, concerts are canceled or postponed. Should this occur, we will attempt to contact you to inform you of refund or exchange procedures for that concert. For exact instructions on any canceled or postponed concert, please check the concert information online or <a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/How-do-I-contact-Customer-Service?language=en_US" rel="noopener">contact us</a>.</p>

                <p>If an event is canceled, and you purchased your ticket through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ticketmaster.com" rel="noopener">Ticketmaster.com</a>, our phone center, or Fan-to-Fan, we will automatically issue you a refund to the credit card, debit card, gift card or the method of payment used to make your purchase.</p>

                <p>If the event was moved or rescheduled, the Event Provider may set refund limitations. If you are unable to make the new event date and refunds have been approved by the Event Provider, you will see a “Refund” button within your order in your Ticketmaster <a target="_blank" href="https://my.ticketmaster.com/account/login?redirect=https://my.ticketmaster.com/account" rel="noopener">account</a>. If you require additional assistance, please <a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/How-do-I-contact-Customer-Service?language=en_US" rel="noopener">contact us</a>.</p>

                <p>If you purchased a ticket and then chose to sell it via Fan-to-Fan, and your ticket has sold and you've been paid, you'll receive an automatic refund for your original purchase and your credit card will be charged to refund the fan who bought your ticket under the following condition(s): 1) for canceled events, 2) if the buyer requests, for moved or rescheduled/postponed (different date or material change in time), or 3) for circumstances in which the Event Provider authorizes refunds.</p>

                <h2>Refunds and Exchanges</h2>

                <p>Before purchasing tickets, carefully review your event and seat selection. Policies set forth by Event Providers generally prohibit us from issuing exchanges or refunds after a ticket has been purchased or for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets. For many events, certain tickets may be exchanged for tickets from us of equal or higher price. A per ticket exchange fee may apply. Exceptions include VIP, Platinum and other premium tickets, tickets purchased through resale, tickets purchased with additional related items and/or bundled products, and tickets for participating teams' away games. In addition, we may occasionally offer tickets at a discount after the original onsale date and will not refund the difference between the original price and the sale price. Seating maps are representative of a venue’s layout; however, they are subject to change at any time and refunds are not allowed if the map is updated or if additional seats/rows are added or seats change as a result of a venue change after purchase. There are no refunds, returns or exchanges for digital downloads or hotel/festival packages.</p>

                <p>You agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any refund prohibitions in any manner with regard to tickets you purchased. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not contact us to seek a refund or exchange from us when we are prohibited from providing one by its clients, and you will not dispute or otherwise seek a "chargeback" from the company whose credit card you used to purchase tickets from the Site. Should you do so, your tickets are subject to immediate cancellation, and we may, in our sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future ticket purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit future purchases from all persons in whose name the credit card accounts exist and any person who accesses any associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches this provision from using the Site.</p>

                <p>If we issue you a refund for a ticket due to a canceled or postponed event, we will issue a refund of the ticket's face value paid (or, for a discounted ticket, then instead the discounted ticket price paid) and all service fees. If a ticket was purchased through Fan-to-Fan, the event was canceled and/or a refund is issued, we will issue a refund of the ticket price you paid through Fan-to-Fan and the service fee (if any) you paid. No service fees refunded for certain Major League Baseball purchases. In no event will UPS charges or any other amounts be refunded. For ticket insurance refunds, please contact the insurance provider. If a refund is issued, it will be issued using the same method of payment that was used to purchase the tickets. We will not be liable for travel or any other expenses that you or anyone else incurs in connection with a canceled or postponed event.</p>

                <h2>Special Refund Provisions Applying to TicketExchange and Fan-to-Fan Resale</h2>

                <p>The following applies only to resale tickets to Illinois events: If you purchase resale tickets to an event located in Illinois, you will receive a refund of the amount you paid for that resale ticket if (a) the ticketed event is canceled (in which case you will not receive a refund of any delivery fees), (b) that ticket does not allow you to enter the ticketed event for reasons that may include, without limitation, that the ticket is counterfeit or that the ticket has been canceled by the issuer due to non-payment, unless the ticket is canceled due to an act or omission by you, (c) that ticket fails to conform to its listing description, or (d) you failed to receive that ticket.</p>

                <p>The following applies only to resale tickets to New York events: If you purchase a resale ticket to an event located in New York, you will receive a refund of the amount you paid for that resale ticket if: (a) the ticketed event is canceled (in which case you will not receive a refund of any order processing and delivery fees); (b) that ticket does not allow you to enter the ticketed event, unless the ticket is canceled due to an act or omission by you; or (c) that ticket fails to conform to its listing description unless you have pre-approved a substitution of tickets.</p>

                <h2>Account, Order, and Billing Information Verification</h2>

                <p>All information on accounts and orders must be valid and are subject to verification. Orders that are placed, or attempted to be placed, using an account in which any information entered is found to be false, misleading, incorrect, incomplete or cannot be verified as belonging to the account holder, such as name, address, email address, phone number, IP address, or other, are subject to cancellation, at any time. Furthermore, we may cancel your order and sell your tickets to another customer without further notice. Orders are subject to credit card approval and processed only after the billing address, associated with your credit card, and other billing information, has been verified.</p>

                <h2>Delivery Options</h2>

                <p>Different combinations of delivery methods may be offered, depending on factors that include the venue or country where the event is to be held, the country in which you live, how much time is left before the event starts, whether it is a holiday season and the nature of the demand for the event. Please carefully review the list of delivery methods offered during the purchase process. For security purposes, we can only ship tickets to the billing address on file with the credit card company that is used for your purchase.</p>

                <p>Generally, some of the following delivery methods may be offered:</p>

                <ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/What-is-Mobile-Entry?language=en_US" rel="noopener">Mobile</a> - for events that occur in the United States or Canada if the venue has installed and enabled equipment necessary to support this technology.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/US-mail-Canadian-mail-time-frame?language=en_US" rel="noopener">Standard Mail</a> - for events that occur in the United States or Canada, but only if you make your ticket order at a time that is sufficiently before the date of the event. If the event is in the United States, then you will only be able to use this method if you have a United States or Canadian billing address.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/What-is-Print-at-Home?language=en_US" rel="noopener">Print-at-Home</a> - for events that occur in the United States or Canada if the venue has installed and enabled equipment necessary to support this technology.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/Where-do-I-pick-up-will-call-tickets?language=en_US" rel="noopener">Will Call</a> - for events that occur in the United States or Canada.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/Courier-delivery-information-Canadian-events?language=en_US" rel="noopener">Courier Delivery</a> - for events that occur in Canada, but only for purchasers who use a Canadian billing address.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/UPS-delivery-information-U-S-events?language=en_US" rel="noopener">UPS</a> - for events that occur in the United States, but only for purchasers who use a United States billing address.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/Shipping-to-an-APO-FPO-Billing-Address?language=en_US" rel="noopener">Shipping to APO/FPO Addresses</a> - for events that occur in the United States, tickets can be delivered to an Armed Forces billing address via standard mail. You may also choose to print tickets at home using Print-at-Home, or pick up tickets at will call, provided that these delivery options are available for your event.

                <h2>Pricing and Other Errors</h2>

                <p>If the amount you pay for a ticket is incorrect regardless of whether because of an error in a price posted on this Site or otherwise communicated to you, or you are able to order a ticket before its scheduled on-sale or presale date or you are able to order a ticket that was not supposed to have been released for sale, then we will have the right to cancel that ticket (or the order for that ticket) and refund to you the amount that you paid. This will apply regardless of whether because of human error or a transactional malfunction of this website or other Ticketmaster operated system. We will not be liable for travel or any other expenses that you, or anyone else, incurs in connection with errors of this nature.</p>

                <h2>Multiple Browser Windows</h2>

                <p>When ordering tickets online with us, please ensure you are looking for tickets and placing an order using only one browser window. Looking up tickets using multiple browser windows could result in losing your tickets, errors occurring during the purchase process, or timer expiration.</p>

                <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

                <p>Balls, pucks, and other objects may fly into the spectator area during an event. Despite spectator shielding, injury can occur. Stay alert at all times before, during and after play or performance. If struck, immediately ask an usher for directions to a medical station. You voluntarily assume all risks and danger incidental to the event for which the ticket is issued, whether occurring before, during or after the event, and you waive any claims for personal injury or death against us, management, facilities, leagues, artists, other participants, and all of our respective parents, affiliated entities, agents, officers, directors, owners and employees on behalf of yourself and any accompanying minor. You bear all risks of inclement weather. Event date and time are subject to change. See the Limitation of Liability section in the <a target="_blank" href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/article/Terms-of-Use?language=en_US" rel="noopener">Terms of Use</a> for additional limits on our liability.</p>

                <h2>License; Ejection and Cancellation; No Redemption Value</h2>

                <p>You agree to comply with all of the Event Providers' applicable rules, policies, terms and conditions ("Event Provider Rules"). Event Providers reserve the right, without refund of any amount paid, to refuse admission to, or eject, any person whose conduct management deems disorderly, who uses vulgar or abusive language or who fails to comply with Event Provider Rules. Breach of terms or rules will terminate your license to attend the event without refund. A ticket is a revocable license and admission may be refused upon refunding the ticket's face amount. A ticket is not redeemable for cash.</p>

                <h2>Recording, Transmission and Exhibition</h2>

                <p>You agree that the event for which you purchase tickets is a public event, that your appearance and actions inside and outside the venue where the event occurs are public in nature, and that you have no expectation of privacy with regard to your actions or conduct at the event. You grant permission to us, the Event Provider(s), our partners, licensees and assigns, including but not limited to our brand and media partners, to utilize your name, image, likeness, acts, poses, plays, appearance, movements, and statements in any live or recorded audio, video, or photographic display or other transmission, exhibition, publication or reproduction made of, or at, the event (regardless of whether before, during or after play or performance) for any purpose, in any manner, in any medium or context now known or hereafter developed, without further authorization from, or compensation to, you or anyone acting on your behalf.</p>

                <h2>You Are Subject to Search</h2>

                <p>You and your belongings may be searched on entry to the event. You consent to such searches and waive any related claims that may arise. If you elect not to consent to such searches, you may be denied entry to the event without refund or other compensation. Under certain facility rules, certain items may not be brought into the premises, including without limitation, firearms, alcohol, drugs, controlled substances, cameras, recording devices, laser pointers, strobe lights, irritants (e.g., artificial noisemakers), bundles and containers.</p>

                <h2>Unlawful Resale of Tickets; Promotions</h2>

                <p>Unlawful resale (or attempted resale), counterfeit or copy of tickets is grounds for seizure and cancellation without compensation. Certain maximum resale premiums and restrictions may apply in some states and we cannot be responsible for providing legal advice regarding resale or pricing of tickets. You are responsible for complying with all applicable ticket resale laws. In addition, we reserve the right to restrict or deny ticket purchasing privileges to anyone that we determine to be, or has been, in violation of our policies. Because we do not guarantee the authenticity of tickets purchased from any non-authorized third party reseller (such as brokers or individuals), we recommend that you purchase tickets directly through us, authorized partners or from the venue box office to ensure ticket authenticity. Tickets may not be used for advertising, promotions, contests or sweepstakes, unless formal written authorization is given by us.</p>
